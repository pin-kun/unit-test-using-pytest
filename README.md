# unit-test-using-pytest
Here I used pytest for unit testing.

##### What am I testing here?
  - Models
  - DRF (Django Rest Framework) / API Tetsing
  - Views
  
  
##### What am I using for testing?
  - I have tested using Django Model Tests `TestCase`
  - Tested using `Pytest`
  - Using `hypothesis` library with `pytest` which gives us lots of benefits and easeness while testing
